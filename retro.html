			<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
			<p>First of all, the laziness which is always with me makes me afraid of writing essays or articles. However, I know a lot of news, histories, philosophy and my tongue is very good. These two traits are contradictively living in my body and make me confused until I took this writing course, because this is the first writing course that teach me how to translate ideas and conversations into literature words in essay. And it reminds me of that my fluent speaking can also help me in my writing, which means a lot to me.</p>
			<p>When I was doing my first project lived experience, I realized this course is going to be a challenge for me, because the last time I remembered that I wrote an essay over 1000 words in English was during my high school Senior year English final exam. That paper actually take my three weeks. Therefore, at the beginning of this assignment, it took me a while to find a appropriate topic and organize my ideas. Honestly, i don’t have too many childhood dreams or experiences that help me to decide my life path. I had to construct a connection between my career and lived experiences. Finally I found one, which is piano. Then the real writing process racked my brain. Since this is an narrative instead of an essay, I strive to make the writing style of my article more arbitrary rather than formal and academic. After years of learning how to form a formal style of writing, this was the most burdensome part for me.</p>
			<p>However, I believe that most of you maybe are going to have the same situation as I had, which is no matter how hard you try to abandon the mode of writing essay, your narrative still read like an essay(one). Since we are all familiar with essay, so all you need to do is distinguish major differences between narrative and essay. Words below are my thoughts about how to make a distinction of these two. As to essays, they major concentrate on the theories you raise, or the arguments you expound.</p>
			<p>Things are quite different for narratives, Literally, narrative is a kind of record because it values things and persons themselves the most. A good narrative could clearly narrate things happen in where at when by who and deliver these information to audiences. After I figured this out then worked on this for a few days, my first narrative finished, and what surprised me was that the feedback of my narrative story was good, but another thing is I still need to work on my discussion and connection.</p>
			<p>The second project cultural analysis, a pure essay which required us to demonstrate the relationship between an artifact and social issue, provided students a chance to deliver their emotions and opinions about this society to audiences with writing. And honestly, I really appreciated this assignment because it was the first official essay that I had a chance to state the situation and the issue of my favorite sports in the world (not all people actually seriously consider it as a sport), the E-sports, therefore, I put plenty of efforts and love on making this report. In order to make my essay well-organized, convictive and attractive, I searched lots of informations on the internet and interviewed some of my friends to get a conclusion from a prospective as objective as possible. The interviewing part interested me  the most. Because that is in this part of work, I realized that my oral English ability comes into my writing, too. And two of my training abilities, one of my hobbies, all things wonderfully connected in this part. So I really started to love this lesson from that moment. In my opinion, the two most significant parts of this assignment are researching and combination. As a college level essay, logical analysis is above other writing characters such as rhetoric. During this project, I did not only thoroughly realize the process of organizing a good essay, but also understand more significances about this topic and society. It provides me a wider horizontal to look at our world, which is precious for a new student in university and also for a man who is going to get into this society.</p>
			<p>As a highly required writer in this project, the formal research project is a quite complicated project for me. I was required to read both scholarly articles and magazines, and collect information orderly so that I can introduce a discipline to audiences who are unfamiliar with it.</p>
			<p>The hardest part for this project is writer as a freshman of university usually hadn’t take any major courses, in the other words, you have to figure the discipline first before you could explain or introduce it to others. In addition, there is a new factor has been brought out which is called audience. Generally, you should realize that this project or essay does not only write for professors and yourself anymore, and it should attach importance to audiences. Audiences are not only third visual characters of your work, because they do not just judge your work in minds, they talk about it. And the images your work leave in audiences hearts make up a part of your work. So to some degree, audiences make your work what it is going to be.</p>
			<p>As soon as I realized the core of this assignment, the preparation of starting writing for this project cost me plenty of time. At the beginning, reading articles almost killed me because professional articles’ length usually is over ten pages. And they always contain a lot of technical vocabularies. After reading, collecting and concluding contents of article is a huge process since I have to translate those informations into my own words then write into my essay which could make professional ideas easier to understand by audiences. After all those steps, I need to organized everything and made these unrelated fragments together, and transform them to a logical essay. The entire process is very tough, but I have to admit I had learned plenty of knowledges through out this project. It’s really inspiring, maybe there are moments that I nearly want to drop it, but I finished it and I have acquired a lot. I believe, his case will support me through the coming difficulties in my life or school stuffs. Presently, I know not only how to write a formal research paper, but also knowledges and informations about my major as well. It is a really beneficial assignment for me.</p>
			<p>There is no doubt that the last assignment Remix project is the most comprehensive assignment in this course. It is quite different from previous projects in general ways, because it is not only about writing, but also requires abilities of communication with people, organization of plan and application of technology. There are a few sections in this project---organizing, researching and producing. I’m responsible for organizing, which include constructing a blueprint for this assignment and a calendar of making process. Since I am an international student, communication and cooperation with local students could be the hardest part. Cultural differences make our discussion diversified, but they also mean we could have many divergences that really are obstacles affect our plan. However, I solve this difficulty by putting more efforts in listening different ideas and communicating with my group members, then collect everyone’s opinions to find final solution. From this assignment, I understood differences in ways of thinking between American students and Chinese students and learned skills of communicating and cooperating with people have different cultures and come from different cultural backgrounds. Distinguishing advantages and disadvantages of modes of thinking, and I improved my capabilities in comprehensive fields.</p>
			<p>Besides learning skills from these various kinds of projects, I have learned how to use tools to make derivates for my essay as well. Github is the most useful online tool in this course. It could help you build your individual online blog which you could edit it to whatever you like, and sharing your essay and ideas with others. Since professor required us make a web vision for each project, we even learned some web programming languages. Among making Remix project, I learned how to make a documentary by myself by using imovie and other softwares, and editing pictures, videos and music.</p>
			<p>All in all, this course not only helped me improving my writing skills, but also provided me plenty of methods which make my articles more formal and scholarly. In the meantime, I learn various kinds of tools that diversified my academics such as making my own websites and blogs on Github. Multiple and complicated writing exercises benefit my capabilities of planning a project and dealing things up to a new level.  And besides the technical acquisition, I also have gained a lot about how to motivate myself in a long process of work. And again, I am really appreciate everything what this writing course benefited me in my first year of college, and I am sure I could do better on my writing path in the future with these precious technics and experience.</p>
