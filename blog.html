			<h1>week 1</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the viodeo “Televangelist Oral Roberts' gay grandson says ‘it gets better’ ” is telling his uncle Ronnie who met an untimely death in 1982 that his path of life, and sharing his opinions about being a gay, which is not a difficulty for him right now. It also delivers a information to the audience that gay is also acceptable and normal because falling in love with someone is beautiful, and people should not discriminate them.</p>
			<p>The producer emphasize his purpose by using memories and thinkings of his gay uncle Ronnie with emotional and moved words. He demonstrates his own path is similar with uncle Ronnie’s and feels same hopeless at the first, but he chose a different path and didn’t make wrong decision.</p>
			<p>The message is narrative. Author uses narration interspersed with flashbacks and picture us what kind of emotions he has as a gay in different stages. Hopeless at the beginning, strong at the middle and finally author defeat everything. This writing skill could develope my contents of lived experienced project in multiple ways. Firstly, my story ands narrative will be more persuasive and moving. Secondly, it could help me to construct a better connection between my story and discussion. Lastly, my structure will be very different and not as boring as others.</p>

			<p>Seems like we have one more new famous example from Mr.Zukerberg that could help us skip the college formal education and start to do business. However, things are not that simple as we observe. Bill Gates gave up his college education as well as Zukerberg, and both of them are genius, but you might not notice they also have a big family which helped them a lot. In my opinion, we cannot blindly follow their path because they have not only special brain, but also opportunities. Let’s talk about Zukerberg since we just finished a movie about his experiences. The son of a dentist and a psychologist, zuckerberg has received good educations since childhood, and he is a computer whiz kid. He got his first computer when he was ten years old. From that moment, he spent all his time on it. Before he entered Havard, he designed an MP3 player when he was in high school, and many famous IT company including Microsoft wanted hire him after that, but he defused.<p>
			<p>Only people like him could establish famous Facebook and gave up formal education, if you are not his kind of people, like me, formal education is an better option.<p>

			<h1>Sep.1st 2013</h1>
			<p>When I was still in high school, college looms in the distance like an ominous cloud. Frankly, all of my friends  were scared about going to college. When everyone go to college they feel like going to the great unknown to go to a place where they don't know anyone. College it will be something new because you will be in a new place and have new people around you. With college living is different you get to stay there be away from home and family. College will also be hard work because you have to have good grades or you will get put out. College is going to be something new, different, and hard work.<p>
			<p>College will be new because it is something you have not been through before. You have a home away from home. You make new friends, and you learn how to be your own person. You have to do that because no one will be there to look after you. You really have to learn how to use your time the best way you can. You don?t have you mom on at all times. You have lots of freedom.<p>
			<p>It will be different because it?s not like high school your teacher on you about homework or study for a test. If you miss too many days of the class you can be taken out of the class. You really have to keep up with your class you cannot fall be hide on them because the teacher will not just stop for you. They will not even know your name you will be a number not like with high school where everyone knows you. They do not call your mom if you did not do your homework or if you did not pass a test. It will also be a fun place to be. You have the parties and stuff the games.<p>
			<p>College will be new and different like all in the same way. Most of the stuff that is different may also be new to you too. I think that it will be hard work at the same time.But after all college is not that bad. Wow! I can’t believe the first week of college was a breeze. All my professors seemed so nice. I did not have to carry any books to class for that whole week. Finding classes was some what tough, even though my classes are around the same area. I did not have lots of  homework to do. I did not see my friends as much but we hung out as much as we could. I can go to some different parties to make more friends and still attended all of my classes. I do not need a bed time and lights out. I know how to get up, but now things have changed. <p>
