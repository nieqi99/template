			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>    Therefore, we draw a conclusion that the opinion of "Video game = E-sports" is wrong. E-sports project along with the development of the gaming industry, constantly change, e-sports is no longer restricted to IP directly connected or LAN games. Although network game in distribution, operations, payment method, and on the platform to build of the game is very different, but it doesn't affect some balance and provide online join the e-sports project. Regardless of stand-alone game (single), or a network game (multiplayer), as long as in line with the "electronic" "competitive" these two characteristics, so they can be called a broadly e-sports games. However, besides the significances of the e-sports had been misunderstood since it was born, or they brought another more important social issue which the society also never really accept e-sports as a sports. In next several paragraphs, I am going to take CyberGameâ€™s different histories in China and Korean as the example to state that e-sports benefits a society and makes social issues. </p>
