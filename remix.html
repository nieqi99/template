			<h1>MEMO: Documentary: Miracle and Jr Hockey</h1>
			<p>The experience of making this documentary is very meaningful to me, because this is the first official time that i as an international student work on a project with domestic students. At the beginning, we had a special meeting which only discuss topic and how to separate works. We have 2 optional topics which are college hockey and supply chain management. Considering we are all freshman, supply chain management is not a very wise choice since it requires plenty of professional knowledges, and coleege hockey is much related to us. Obviously, this help us a lot in understanding the purpose and plan of this project in order to finish our own part of job easier. Our proposal was systematacially done in a few hours, then we actually start to work.</p>
			<p>Our documentary is strive to solve the issue of the eligibility of having high education of Junior hockey players through the movie Miracle which mentions about a group of college non-professional hockey players won the Olympic and made a legend. </p>
			<p>Presently, many young teenagers don’t have a chance to pursue their professional dreams while having high educations such as go to college, because the education system or college enrollment system don’t allowed them to do that. This documentary will bring out some ideas and opinions about present education system from different kinds of prospective in order to not only help young hockey player to achieve both high education and profession dream, but also teenagers who are pursuing in other kinds of abnormal sports or fields.</p>
			<p>Society often automatically consider those abnormal fields or sports as abnormal things. This kind of attitude would mislead more and more people that they actually is abnormal, so we certainly need to abnormally deal with these things. I think the reason why this is happening is that these “abnormal” things are not traditional. In our nature, people always consider old path first instead of picking unexplored path because we are afraid of anything we don’t know. Audiences would abandon those traditional ideas after they watch our documentary. We perform a real and deep picture of their hearts to the audiences such as aspirations and bitters of a young hockey player(junior hockey player) in order to help our audience fully understand our goal. Then, they could help us together to fix our system and support those teens.</p>
			<p>My distribution to this project is mainly about organizing the entire group and giving each individual their tasks. In the meantime, i am also responsible for helping making video such as shooting during our interview MSU hockey players section. The most difficult part for me obviously is the communication. As i said, this is the first time i cooperate with American students, so language and cultural differences make my organizing very tough. In order to finish my work perfectly, i draw a blueprint that contains all ideas and allocation about this project,. This really make me to communicate with my team-mates much easier and also clearly delivered each individual ideas to each other. However, there are still a few points that i could have done better such as making a time calender for reminding my team the progress of our project, etc.</p>
			<p>All in all, We design our topics and contents very approachable and thorough, and we really made a wonderful documentary that is very related to our college life and age by demonstrating junior and college hockey players’s life and thoughts as well as all college students who are strive to chase their dream. Everyone born even, and we hope that people could treat everyone fair especially those who has different and colorful dreams.</p>
