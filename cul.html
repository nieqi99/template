			<h1>about me</h1>
			<p>　　Before we enter the essay, i want to mention a present event of CyberGame. On October 4, the staples center in Los Angeles, USA ushered in the "League of Legend" S3 finals this year, the royal club, composed of five Chinese guy, face a championship battle with south Korean rivals SKT1, attracted the attention of more than 10 million people worldwide.</p>
			<p>    Video game, one of the most popular entertainments and pop culture in the world, is full of teenagers’ life. It is able to create an illusory space that we are unlimited and satisfied, We could do many things that not allowed or cannot in the real world. People have a lot of fun with video games, however, it indeed is just a leisure activity for public, and nobody considers it as an sports until the idea of E-sports or CyberGame was born. A brand-new sports which contains highly modern technology and sprit of competitiveness of human. However, the contradiction and misunderstanding between society and Cybergame are still exist. In this essay, I’m going to demonstrate this social issue which exist between society and e-sports, and the method to solve it by stating the contrast of the history of e-sports in China and Korean. At first, let’s figure out what exactly is e-sports.</p>
			<p>　　E-sports has two basic characteristics: electronics, sports."Electronic" is its ways and means, refers to the sport with the help of information technology as the core of all kinds of hardware and software, and, by the construction of environment to the similar in traditional sports equipment and venues. In the e-sports, rely on information technology to implement the "equipment", this is also the competitive difference with traditional sports.</p>
			<p>    "Competitive" refers to the essential characteristic of sports, namely the confrontation. As a sport, to fight is the most basic features. Electronic competitive sports have a variety of classification and the project, but the core must be against, competition.</p>
			<p>    The entire e-sports industry is made by several parts: players, clubs, sponsors, league. "e-sports athletes" refers to those outstanding, through layers of screening and qualify for the electronic competitive professional players of the game. Just like traditional sports athletes, professional player for a game (a program) after long time of practice. Generally divided into professional and amateur players, only difference is that amateur players will take part in the game as a amateur, not professional for the game. Professional players usually belonging to a club/team, form of employment.</p>
			<p>　　Team as well as sports league club (such as teams in the NBA), was organized by athletes gather together and mutual benefit. Professional team typically has a unique identifier (e.g., team logo, colors) and make unified schedule. As the industry standard and game level unceasing enhancement, professional team there are more and more new roles, such as leaders, coaches, analysts, etc., they are usually in charge of team working behind the scenes, such as player instructions and game analysis, etc.</p>
			<p>　　Operation of the club cannot work without sponsors. Sponsors mainly provide funds, goods or related services, and a club or organizers as a sponsor for commercial publicity, form a mutually beneficial relationship. Amateur teams generally have no sponsor, or sponsored by Internet cafes or personal. While professional team mostly have a partnership with a enterprise.</p>
			<p>　　Leagues are organized by manufacturers or e-sports association. The WCG "CPL" and "ESWC, known as" the world three big tournaments. General held in league tournament, held once a year, or a year more than one season. According to statistics, total GSL2011 bonuses are about 1.56 billion, and the international invitational tournament DOTA2, LOL S2, S3 finals and 05 CPL, bonus amount more than $2 million.</p>
			<p>　　Therefore, we draw a conclusion that the opinion of "Video game = E-sports" is wrong. E-sports project along with the development of the gaming industry, constantly change, e-sports is no longer restricted to IP directly connected or LAN games. Although network game in distribution, operations, payment method, and on the platform to build of the game is very different, but it doesn't affect some balance and provide online join the e-sports project. Regardless of stand-alone game (single), or a network game (multiplayer), as long as in line with the "electronic" "competitive" these two characteristics, so they can be called a broadly e-sports games. However, besides the significances of the e-sports had been misunderstood since it was born, or they brought another more important social issue which the society also never really accept e-sports as a sports. In next several paragraphs, I am going to take CyberGame’s different histories in China and Korean as the example to state that e-sports benefits a society and makes social issues. </p>
			<p>　　Stop at the staples center in Los Angeles, USA satellite trucks, one ticket of the final is hard to find, more than 200 media to broadcast live. On October 4, the world's most popular "League of Legend" S3 finals held in the United States. Many people find it hard to believe that a e-sport competition could cause such pomp.</p>
			<p>    Like the World Cup, from Europe, North America, South Korea, China and other 14 teams, compete for the championship trophy "summoner cup" together, the champion can get as much as $1 million in prize money. Like sports stars, each e-sports teams also have fans, studio, team leader and coach in the United States. Recently, the United States citizenship and immigration services web-site is announced, officially recognized online game players "League of Legend" (LOL) is a professional athlete. You could even immigrate to the United States by professional LOL players athletes work visa.</p>
			<p>　　However, Chinese society has a very different view about e-sports than Western country or south Korean. As early as 2003, esports is 99th formal sports in China, but in 10 years, controversy has never stopped for it. In China, many people still holds the idea of "doing nothing" about e-sports. Smoky Internet cafe, his mouth constantly swearing - Internet cafe "punk" is still a lot of people of e-sports practitioners ", "subjective impression. Although esports become formal sports in 2003, e-sports club rise all over the country, e-sports teams appear in succession, but could have been a handful of stick. Many clubs show up in a short time period, eventually collapse because of a loss.</p>
			<p>　　Today, e-sports as sports development in China has been for 10 years, but e-sports industry didn't  bring any changes to the domestic, at present it still has not formed a complete industrial chain. Although, according to an industry report as early as in 2006 China's participation in the number of e-sports has been exceeded total population of 40 million, close to South Korea national population, but the contrast of the electronic competitive social environment of the two countries, found that there is a huge gap.</p>
			<p>　　In South Korea, parents turn the child to e-sports team closer to the dormitory from professional elementary school for their children to play games; In China, family is filled with "break your legs if you play video games" scolding. E-sports club sponsors is in South Korea, LG, samsung, Korean air, and even the air force; E-sports club in China, many funds mainly come from computer parts and components manufacturers such as motherboard, memory chips, keyboard mouse sponsorship. E-sports stars in South Korea, the news is not lower than the film stars, a former President roh moo-hyun has is the honorary chairman of WCG, e-sports's contribution to the country's GDP more than cars, is the government strongly support the industry; In China, sports authorities acknowledge that the status of e-sports, but according to the China electronic athletic club league secretary-general PeiLe understand --- the social status of e-sports is not high.</p>
			<p>    E-sports industry in South Korea, was once a third pillar of GDP. In the national finals in shortly after the “League of Legend” S3 SKT1 from South Korea team win the championship. In South Korea, e-sports industry is very serious. It brings to the South Korea billions of dollars in economic benefits every year. E-sports in Korea has been successfully realize the industrialization development. South Korea is a veritable electronic competitive power, from the original starcraft from rose to the height of the competitive game, South Korea e-sports industry have been soaring, eventually be tied with the auto, steel and other industry for one of the pillars of the national economy. And esports and l-go, and soccer and also called South Korea's three kingdoms.</p>
			<p>    In 1997 Asian financial crisis, South Korea 5.8% GDP growth in 1998 backward, the substantial depreciation of the won 50%, the stock market plunged more than 70%, large Numbers of people out of work. In 1998, starcraft in South Korea after the release, many people use the game to kill time, a south Korean television producers a brainwave, started making starcraft related programs, starcraft and then quickly popular in Korea. South Korea noticed their industrial structure exist serious problem: the state of the economy the pillar industry of national economy are export-oriented, affected by the world economic environment change is too big. In the wake of the financial crisis, the Korean government began to change the industrial structure. Soon, the south Korean film and television industry, game animation industry began to get government support and rapid development. It is this accidental historical opportunity, makes an amazing Korean e-sports industry now.</p>
			<p>    I have to admit that Korean is doing better than Chinese in this social issue, because they build an example to the world that CyberGame could be a great business. Korean’s society made a wonderful environment for e-sports by a good timing and opportunity. It created a complete industrial chain for CyberGame which benefits player and economy at same time. Most importantly, eliminated the misunderstanding from people which makes e-sports is a profession more acceptable and those teenagers who really pursue to be an professional CyberGame athlete could get support by their parents and society . China, however, the idea has been implementing the stereotype of the old society. Parents think playing game is just playing game, useless and wasted. There is not any benefits to future. Many parents agree that such thing as a game bring nothing but harm. This is why the door of Chinese e-sports covered with a layer of hazy veil.</p>
			<p>　　All in all, CyberGame still has a long journey to travel in this complicated world, but pioneer Korean has made an example format of running CyberGame industry in both social way and cultural path, which i think the core of this format is the support of government. Since “governments” are the main brain of humanities, things always happen if government recognize it no matter it is on the ground or underground. Therefore, the source of developing e-sports industry must be to get support and acceptance from government. Same as the Olympic Game, the World Cup and NBA, every country or its government support these events which makes these objects such as soccer and basketball in events could be professions. I really expect there is a day that e-sports could become famous as basketball or soccer. People could recognize e-sports as a real sports from deep heart instead of teenagers entertainment.</p>
