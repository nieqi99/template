			<h1>Activity 1</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the viodeo “Televangelist Oral Roberts' gay grandson says ‘it gets better’ ” is telling his uncle Ronnie who met an untimely death in 1982 that his path of life, and sharing his opinions about being a gay, which is not a difficulty for him right now. It also delivers a information to the audience that gay is also acceptable and normal because falling in love with someone is beautiful, and people should not discriminate them.</p>
			<p>The producer emphasize his purpose by using memories and thinkings of his gay uncle Ronnie with emotional and moved words. He demonstrates his own path is similar with uncle Ronnie’s and feels same hopeless at the first, but he chose a different path and didn’t make wrong decision.</p>
			<p>The message is narrative. Author uses narration interspersed with flashbacks and picture us what kind of emotions he has as a gay in different stages. Hopeless at the beginning, strong at the middle and finally author defeat everything. This writing skill could develope my contents of lived experienced project in multiple ways. Firstly, my story ands narrative will be more persuasive and moving. Secondly, it could help me to construct a better connection between my story and discussion. Lastly, my structure will be very different and not as boring as others.</p>
		    <h1>Activity 2</h1>
			<p>Seems like we have one more new famous example from Mr.Zukerberg that could help us skip the college formal education and start to do business. However, things are not that simple as we observe. Bill Gates gave up his college education as well as Zukerberg, and both of them are genius, but you might not notice they also have a big family which helped them a lot. In my opinion, we cannot blindly follow their path because they have not only special brain, but also opportunities. Let’s talk about Zukerberg since we just finished a movie about his experiences. The son of a dentist and a psychologist, zuckerberg has received good educations since childhood, and he is a computer whiz kid. He got his first computer when he was ten years old. From that moment, he spent all his time on it. Before he entered Havard, he designed an MP3 player when he was in high school, and many famous IT company including Microsoft wanted hire him after that, but he defused.<p>
			<p>Only people like him could establish famous Facebook and gave up formal education, if you are not his kind of people, like me, formal education is an better option.<p>
			<h1>Activity 3</h1>
			<p>I am pretty sure the positioning is the most valuable thing to focus on, if you are strive to  make or design a successful advertisement for a product or a brand. This Chrysler commercial obviously is an example. Chrysler, as one of the most famous and historical automobile manufacturer in the USA, clearly delivered two significant informations to audiences through this ad. Firstly, its new type of vehicle is coming with luxury design and comfortable customer experience. Telling audiences what is the positioning of our this new type of vehicle, and this commercial exactly expressed this message even upgraded it. Secondly, besides this beautiful new car, commercial also demonstrate the inner connection between Chrysler and Detroit. Detroit, the mobile city of the USA, has plenty of honors. As well as Chrysler, they love this ciry and they are proud of being part of Detroit and that is why they put the tagline “Imported from Detroit”, and the voiceover clearly state this as well.<p>

			<p>When I was still in high school, college looms in the distance like an ominous cloud. Frankly, all of my friends  were scared about going to college. When everyone go to college they feel like going to the great unknown to go to a place where they don't know anyone. College it will be something new because you will be in a new place and have new people around you. With college living is different you get to stay there be away from home and family. College will also be hard work because you have to have good grades or you will get put out. College is going to be something new, different, and hard work.<p>
			<p>College will be new because it is something you have not been through before. You have a home away from home. You make new friends, and you learn how to be your own person. You have to do that because no one will be there to look after you. You really have to learn how to use your time the best way you can. You don?t have you mom on at all times. You have lots of freedom.<p>
			<p>It will be different because it?s not like high school your teacher on you about homework or study for a test. If you miss too many days of the class you can be taken out of the class. You really have to keep up with your class you cannot fall be hide on them because the teacher will not just stop for you. They will not even know your name you will be a number not like with high school where everyone knows you. They do not call your mom if you did not do your homework or if you did not pass a test. It will also be a fun place to be. You have the parties and stuff the games.<p>
			<p>College will be new and different like all in the same way. Most of the stuff that is different may also be new to you too. I think that it will be hard work at the same time.But after all college is not that bad. Wow! I can’t believe the first week of college was a breeze. All my professors seemed so nice. I did not have to carry any books to class for that whole week. Finding classes was some what tough, even though my classes are around the same area. I did not have lots of  homework to do. I did not see my friends as much but we hung out as much as we could. I can go to some different parties to make more friends and still attended all of my classes. I do not need a bed time and lights out. I know how to get up, but now things have changed. <p>
			<h1>Sep. 8th 2013</h1>
			<p>The second week I find college schedules are a difficult thing to balance. A person must find the time to complete a number of tasks in a day. A normal adult may have time to get everything done and still have time to spare. The normal college student on the other hand is constantly on the go. College students have busy schedules that include working, studying, and socializing. Most college students work. How else are they going to have the money for all those late night pizza deliveries? Part time employees usually eat on the road on the way from school to work. They work about 5 or 6 hours a day and then head home tired and ready for bed. Maybe not every night but usually there is some kind of paper to be written or chapter to be read. Full time college students that are also full-time workers have to plan everything out in order to make the time to get everything done. One of the things most college students don't make time for is housework. They often wait until everything is dirty to start the laundry. Dishes are another thing that tend to pile up. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner plates and glasses add up after a week. So after two weeks I understand I must find time in my busy schedules to study. In order to keep up they must do daily assignments. Reading every night helps to prepare for the exams. Taking notes in class and out of class are also necessary. Because everyone also have exams at the end of the semester that require hours of studying. Waiting until the last minute and then cramming it all in is often a final resort. Many students who have kept up just go over and recall the information. All of all must find time to study in order to pass. 
Therefore, how to balance my study time and enjoy my college life became the frist class I need learn when I came to College.<p>

			<p>My first test grade in college come out, and it is not quite good enough. However, I realize that the college education, to many people, means that it is the opportunity to learn and absorb knowledges to prepare them for life. To others it means they are finally free of supervision and it is their time to have fun and enjoy themselves (These usually do not last long because they flunk out). Then there are those who try to combine both and either succeed or fail. We know that bad habits are detrimental to cognition in general. There are new studies that show drinking to excess, bad eating, and partying have devastating effects on learning and memory. College may be one of the worst possible environments to learn something and retain it.<p>
			<h1>Sep.22nd 2013</h1>
			<p>It is hard to believe that I have been in college for months now. I'd have to admit that at first I was pretty nervous about the huge transformation. The difference between college and high school is like one extreme to the other. In college some things are pleasant and some things aren't so pleasant. So far I would have to say that I've enjoyed college life because of the freedom I feel, the new people that I have met, and the feeling of accomplishment that fulfills my soul.<p>
			<p>In high school students spend six straight hours in school every day. For me many of those long days seemed unbearable. Now I have the freedom to work around me. After a morning class I can go out for a bite of lunch or I can even get a little homework done. The fact that I can come and go as I please just thrills me. The pressure of a long day doesn't seem to bother me because I know that the next day I won't have any classes. It is truly great! <p>

			<p>I don’t know why there is a lots of friends call me and tell me they are sick because of they have no time for sleeping. They study all the time… I know stress in college is caused by many influencing factors. One of these important factors would have to be the expectations set by parents. Parents can be more then just an annoying voice in your ear every time you come home for the holidays. They are normally the reason you are at your present school , so pleasing them by getting good grades is almost mandatory. This thought of displeasing the parents can be detrimental to one's thought process; meaning that it most likely would cause a world of stress for the student. Worrying about receiving good grades is just another thing that most students don't need to add to their "to do list". This added pressure does nothing for students but makes them think that if they don't get wonderful marks in school that they wont be accepted at home anymore. When in reality all the parents want is their kid to get a great job, and have a future. But I really want to tell them that a normal person spends one-third of their lives asleep. Stanford University recently surveyed undergraduates and medical students and found that 80% of them were sleep deprived. The National Sleep Foundation poll found that young adults got only 6.8 hours of sleep a night. Sleep is crucial to declarative memory which helps us to remember facts. It is also essential for procedural memory which helps us to learn procedures like math calculations. Matt Walker, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School, said, "Practice makes perfect, but having a night's rest after practicing might make you even better. Walker took 100 people and taught them to type out a series of nonsense sequences on a keyboard. The people hadn't improved when they were asked to repeat the procedure. Walker then allowed one group of students to sleep overnight before retesting them. Their speed and accuracy improved by 20 to 30%. He discovered that, for procedural memory, the last two hours of sleep was the most important and for declarative memory, the first two hours. This shows that memory requires a full eight hours of sleep. Pulling an all-nighter to study for an exam may help you pass, but you may not remember any of the material next semester. So take care, my friends. <p>

			<p>This week I has to be crazy about my Biology class. But I really don't want to drop my class. This truly realize that I have to go to college. Before, the feeling as long as listen carefully in class, homework finish by myself then the test must be no problem. But went to college only to find that, even if listen carefully in class, and still can't write exam. Different, a professor at the university of senior high school teachers, they don't have much time to take us to review again and again, to correct the mistakes in homework, they left the class also does not take the initiative to come over to ask our students do you have any questions. Feeling is the teacher with us before learning, but the university is fighting alone. We only prepare first, and then review, in the professor's office hour to discuss with him. We must spend much more time on each subjects we can get a beautiful GPA. So I decided I will change my attitude to learning, absolutely not as easily as the high school mentality towards university. Now is the first months of school, I still have a lot of time to catch up.<p>
			<h1>Oct.13rd 2013</h1>
			<p>This weekend I watch a moive with my roomate named “The Professional”. The film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. The exploitative relationship between Leon and his boss is telling as well, and this all this extra detail serves to draw you into Leon's life. By the end of this film you really care for him - he seems a real human being, who just happens to have super human prowess. The direction has just the right mixture of grittiness and humanity. Its triumph is to give each character a human edge. Through Leon's love for his plant and old movies we see another side to the icy cool cleaner. While he's the only one in the theater, and is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen, it shows the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy. Also through the relationship that he and Mathilda form we get telling insights into the nature of loneliness. If I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in elementary or high school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into cliches, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love gives meaning to our lives.<p>

			<p>How beautiful of the first snow’s coming! when snow flutters down, soundless, hour after hour while we are asleep. Outside the closed curtains of the bedroom a vast transfbrmation scene is takiag place, just as if a myriad elves and brownies were at work, and we turn and yawn and stretch and know nothing about it. I think that the magic of snowing. You go to bed in one kind of world and wake up to find yourself in another quite different. I miss snow! My high school in Utah is also a place from October entered in winter and full of snow. See the snowflakes leaping, dancing like flowers in the whirling wind. The flowers have six angles. Sometimes they are like stars. Sometimes they are only white dots, and they keep on falling gently in silence.<p>
			<p>Without your knowing it, the fields, houses, trees and the whole earth are enwloped in a thin coat of snow. Winter differs from the other seasons in that it is not as warmag spring, neither as hot as summer, nor as sad as autumn. The snowflake has her own grace and inspiration. It seems tender, yet it is amazingly attractive. Some people say snow may bring you joy and happiness. Others think snow can get rid of the dirt in the world. Still others believe snow will purify one＇s soul, and there are those who hold the view that snow can melt all the evils in its purity and sincerely ...... Suddenly,I remembered that snowy day, I and my friends together in front of the dormitory have snowball fights, make a snowman and they are only belong to the high school that the laughter of the young.<p>
			<h1>Oct. 27th 2013</h1>
			<p>Nothing special happened in this week…. I only want to say, “ How freeze cold outside!!!!” I really can’t stand it. For the first time I feel from the bed in the morning is the most of cruel things to oneself, especially that a couple of days have a lesson at eight o 'clock in the morning. Head felt like it was frozen by the cold air outside, after the class I just want to back to the room, suddenly without pursuing goal without power, everything just want to come slowly… I understand “Winter” really is coming! But luckily, one month later is thanksgiving break. Can rest for a few days, go out for a walk, meet several old friends and talk everything any topic， it’s really became my only now learning motivation right now. Think of the holiday, I suddenly a little miss my high school life wildly. Miss playing every day in the group of friends. <p>
			<h1>Nov. 3rd 2013</h1>
			<p>A new month starts! So far, the college experience has made me a changed person. College changed me into a better person on many occasions. I have learned to be more responsible, when it comes down to getting work done. In college you must be responsible. I have also changed my attitude. Moving from high school to college is a big step; if you don't change your ways for the better then you might not be successful in college. When you reach college then is the time that you become an adult.<p>
			<p>Firstly, the college life has changed me for the better. I am much more responsible in many different ways. I had to change my study habits, or should I say I have to get study habits. I high school I never studied, because everything came so easy to me and I could just do the work and end up with passing grades. When I reached college I tried to do the same thing and it didn't work. I had to start studying on a daily basis and it was hard to go from not doing any work to studying every night and on the weekends, I wasn't use to that, but I had to make it a habit or I was not going to make it. Going to school everyday was not a problem because my parents made me go everyday, my major change was my study habits.<p>
			<p>Secondly, the main thing is to be responsible and make the right decisions. In college you have to make decisions and it is hard. Peer pressure come in hard when you get to college, for example you could have a test that you need to study for and there is a party that you want to go to, and all of your friends are going, nine times out of ten you are going to go to the party and say that you're going to study later, but you never get to study, and then you fail the test. That's just one example, there are many more. Another reason college is a big step is because you're on your own, and you don't have nobody to tell you what to do, you make your own decisions.<p>
			<h1>Nov.13rd 2013</h1>
			<p>Almost thanksgiving is coming, lost of exams, essays, projects and presentation also are coming at the same time. So I find losts of friends around me just talk about there are too much stresses in college but I know Academic pressure is an obvious and much talked about stressor in the lives of college students. First, the student must decide what they are going to study. That course of study is a deciding factor of what they will be doing for the rest of their lives. Or at least that is how it feels when deciding. This can be an overwhelming feeling for many young adults. One of the greatest influences of academic pressure is what grade a student receives in any given class. If the grade is not good enough, it can lead to disappointment. There are many people afraid of failure, and when put into that situation it can lead to something else besides stress. Stress goes on to becoming depression. Of course, Depression does not discriminate. It can affect anyone at anytime of their life, though young adults are prime candidates for depressive episodes. Depression is different from than just having the blues‚ or feeling sad for a few days. The symptoms are severe and can be life disrupting. There are also different levels of depression which range from mild to severe. Mild depression is expressed in depressed or sad moods that are brief in duration and have little effect on everyday activities. The more moderate to severe episodes are more long lasting. They interfere with academic work, social relationships and how a person can see him or herself. If depression reaches its pinnacle, it could lead to suicidal thoughts or possible suicide attempts.<p>
			<p>Having stress can be a good thing sometimes, but students have to learn how to cope with it. If they do that they will be just fine. Stress is necessary to challenge students to learn. Approaches are needed that reduce the negative aspects of stress which lessen students' learning and performance (Stanford University research result). The key to reducing distress is providing students with a feeling of control over their education, information about what to expect, and feedback regarding what can be done to improve their performance. Students who do not feel helpless will adopt their own coping strategies. Students shouldn't let their final tests distress you. Recognize situations that may cause stress, develop effective ways to manage stress and seek help if you need it. At last, I think Attitude is always the most important thing, we only view these pressures are correct, we can turn pressure into motivation.<p>
			<h1>Nov.20th 2013</h1>
			<p>I do miss some special people that I basically grew up with through my school years. At first it felt weird not seeing the same people and teachers everyday and I soon came to realize that college wasn't a summer break. I probably know a total of ten different people's names this year and that is out of five classes. Although it is nice to see and meet new people each day.<p>
			<p>As of right know I feel a sense of accomplishment deep inside. I have always struggled with my schoolwork in high school, so you can just imagine how scared I was knowing that college work is ten times harder. I thank God that I am doing well so far. I just have to keep it up and not slack. 
My college experience thus far have been pleasant. I know that times will be ruff and that I will come very close to pulling out my hair too. Unfortunately all good things and bad come with the package. I still have so much growing in my life that has yet to come. My hope is that I will take advantage of all the experiences coming my way as a college student.<p>
