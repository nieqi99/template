			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>    All in all, CyberGame still has a long journey to travel in this complicated world, but pioneer Korean has made an example format of running CyberGame industry in both social way and cultural path, which i think the core of this format is the support of government. Since “governments” are the main brain of humanities, things always happen if government recognize it no matter it is on the ground or underground. Therefore, the source of developing e-sports industry must be to get support and acceptance from government. Same as the Olympic Game, the World Cup and NBA, every country or its government support these events which makes these objects such as soccer and basketball in events could be professions. I really expect there is a day that e-sports could become famous as basketball or soccer. People could recognize e-sports as a real sports from deep heart instead of teenagers entertainment.</p>
