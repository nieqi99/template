		<h1>Music and Finance</h1>
		<p>"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. ... I get most joy in life out of music."               (Albert Einstein)</p>
	    <p>　　The man has made the most significant impact in my life is not a real person but a protagonist of a movie. He showed me the way of entering music world, and more importantly, provided me a new perspective to think about life and methods to deal with difficulties.  </p>
		<p> 　 I couldn't remember the name of the American movie, which had deeply moved me, and made me want to learn piano. I only can recall the scene where the protagonist plays a piece and sings for a girl he loves in a small bar on the very night of their break up. I cannot explain why I felt what I felt at the time, but what I can say is I was thoroughly moved by this man and his piano.</p>
		<p>　　The story of the man has taught me that Music is not just for entertainment, but also can help an individual to know their soul and help find a way out of bleak places when he is stuck. Inspired by this idea and order to know my soul well, I decided to learn how to play piano.  </p>
		<p>    At first, my parents thought my desire was just a whim. Later on, I proved that my parents were wrong, and that my interest in playing is my very soul. Even now when I think back about my decision to play the piano, it really wasn't a decision. </p>
		<p>    Sometimes, a person doesn't need too many reasons or thoughts to make good decisions. The best method for making a decision is to follow your intuition. Once the decision is made never look back. Even though the process and reality of that decision is actually tough, it is better to stay firm in that resolve.  </p>
		<p>　　At the beginning of learning anything new, including piano, drill, repetition and lots of practice is needed in order to accomplish the basic understanding of simple skills E.G. playing on keyboard that we want to know. I spent several months practicing basic scales and to learn sight reading. I had to admit the time we spent of basic and monotonous lessons almost made me gave up because naively I thought learning piano should be more entertaining. However, I realized the necessities of those lessons after I started to really play a piece of music.  </p>
		<p>　　Learning an instrument same as living in the world, there is no such a thing that you can accomplish in one move, following steps and keep moving on are the only rule to achieve success. Presently, I can perform a few pieces of music in front of audiences of school and accept their affirmation. I also can amuse my family and myself, helping them to release their stress from the outside world. In fact, music has became a natural part of my life, and just like Einstein, I probably would be a musician if I don't have other concerns, but I have indeed. </p>
		<p>　　Everyone has their reality and dream, my dream is about music and reality is to be a CFO. I am practioner, but also a theoretician. I pursue interesting and profound theories such as game theory and conflict theory. My studies provide me a theoretical dimension to see things differently and deal with things wisely. In the meantime, I enjoy using theory for practical applications and calculating distances between theory and reality. Therefore, CFO is my favorite final position since first time I heard this title because i think it should be a very challenging job. No matter how much tough to be that position or how many obstacles in front of me, I will strive to get there. Finance, as a field, had always drawn my attention since junior high school. When my father recognized me those traits in me and fueled that interest with Von Neumann and Oskar Morge tern's book "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior". Therefore, the time when I start to learn play the piano, I also start to learn to be a business man. I regularly keep up dated with recent economic affairs by reading the "Financial Times" and "The New Economist" because my father always reads it, and invest my own money in the stock market and I has earned a few money. </p>
		<p>　　You might think there is not connection between music and finance. In my opinion, doing business is same as playing the piano, you have to have a music which is a blueprint or plan when you try to organize your capitals; you need to make decision without hesitating just like you have to decide keep playing the next part of the music or repeat the last part when you make mistakes while you are playing; piano has only two different colors of keys and your have to use both well in order to play a melody which represent the relationship between supplying and demanding in business. Piano and business have so many commons, furthermore, music could inspire me at many times especially tough moment. This is why I choose to do business as my future career. Therefore, I decide to start with supply chain management since I got a wonderful opportunity from MSU. </p>
		<p>    Supply chain management looks like a new born baby which is unfamiliar with Chinese people, and people don’t realize him as well, including myself. However, it’s not true to say supply chain management is a brand-new zone because the application of supply chain management had engaged in Chinese's’ life for a long time. People just didn’t recognize it as an independent industry. If you ask a pretty successful business man about what exactly supply chain management is, he may says he doesn’t know, but I realized its importance. </p>
		<p>    Since internet rapidly grew in China, people realize it has a plenty of  conveniences such as shopping or consumption online. Personally, I love shopping online, because it has multiple advantages such as saving time, more choices and cheaper price. This is the application of supply chain management. Therefore, choosing it as my major is same as deciding to learn play the piano. Others will tell you there is no future for you and it is always not a wise choice for most of people because human generally fear things they don’t know. In other word, people won’t recognize you until you succeed. </p>
		<p>　　Therefore, Life is real simple, you make a decision and never look back because the past cannot be changed and the future is filled with uncertainties. Life as just as in playing piano you cannot stop or start over again while you make a mistake during a performance, and carrying on with the decision is the best choice, so don’t be afraid of making mistakes. I chose my undergraduate major supply chain management without hesitating and affecting by others’ comments, and I believe it will benefit me in my future career which is to be a CFO. </p>
		<p>　　Life as just as in playing piano you cannot stop or start over again while you make a mistake during a performance, and carrying on with the decision is the best choice, so don’t be afraid of making mistakes. Always listen your heart. </p>
