			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>    I have to admit that Korean is doing better than Chinese in this social issue, because they build an example to the world that CyberGame could be a great business. Koreanâ€™s society made a wonderful environment for e-sports by a good timing and opportunity. It created a complete industrial chain for CyberGame which benefits player and economy at same time. Most importantly, eliminated the misunderstanding from people which makes e-sports is a profession more acceptable and those teenagers who really pursue to be an professional CyberGame athlete could get support by their parents and society . China, however, the idea has been implementing the stereotype of the old society. Parents think playing game is just playing game, useless and wasted. There is not any benefits to future. Many parents agree that such thing as a game bring nothing but harm. This is why the door of Chinese e-sports covered with a layer of hazy veil.</p>
